## Hi, I’m Trang.

I learn best by doing, enjoy solving thoughtful problems, and feel most at home with logic, science, and calm, simple aesthetics.  
I’m a mix of practicality and softness — someone who likes both structured thinking and beautiful things.

I grew up in a small coastal city in Vietnam, with a warm childhood and people who shaped me in quiet, meaningful ways.  
Those early memories still stay with me.

Today, I work in credit risk modeling and data science — turning data into insights, building scorecard models, and making sure decisions are fair, stable, and explainable. I’m still learning at my own pace and growing a little every day.

## What I Care About

- Practical, human-centered machine learning  
- Projects that blend logic and creativity  
- Writing as a way to think  
- Small, consistent improvements

## What I Do

In my current role, I build and maintain A-Score and B-Score models, monitor portfolio risk, and design pipelines that keep systems reliable and transparent.

**Tech Stack:** Python, SQL, R, Docker  
**Core Skills:** logistic regression, WOE/IV, scorecards, monitoring

## Where I’m Heading

I’m slowly building a portfolio for future studies in AI/ML — hopefully a Master’s scholarship in Europe or Australia.  
I want to understand ML more deeply, build systems that are thoughtful and responsible, and contribute something meaningful someday.

If you’re reading this — thank you for being here.  
This little space is where I keep track of the things I learn, the projects I try, and the tiny moments that shape who I am.
