## Hi, I’m Trang.
A data scientist building a transition into AI for Healthcare and BioAI. My professional background centers around statistical modeling, machine learning, and developing end-to-end predictive systems that operate at scale. I began my journey in applied ML through credit-risk modeling, where I learned how to work with complex tabular data, design interpretable models, evaluate real-world performance, and build reliable pipelines that serve thousands of users daily.

Over time, I realized that what motivates me the most is not just modeling for business outcomes, but understanding how machine learning can contribute to human health, medical decision-making, and early diagnosis. This led me to explore BioAI — a field where ML is not only technically challenging but also meaningful in its impact. I became especially fascinated by data types that capture human physiology, such as biosignals and spectral data, and the unique modeling challenges they present: small datasets, noise, high variability, and the need for interpretability.

I’m now actively developing the foundations for a long-term path in computational healthcare, combining my strengths in structured data modeling with new knowledge in biomedical data, signal processing, and responsible AI. My goal is to grow into someone who can bridge applied ML engineering with scientific research, working on problems that genuinely benefit clinicians, researchers, and patients.

## 💻 What I Do

- Develop ML models (logistic regression, GBDT, explainability with SHAP)  
- Build automated pipelines with Python/R/SQL, Docker, and monitoring systems  
- Work with structured/tabular data at scale  
- Run experiments, evaluate models, and design reliable data workflows  

These experiences shaped my strengths in modeling, MLOps foundations, and systematic thinking — all of which translate well into biomedical AI.

## 🧠 What I Care About

I’m deeply interested in how AI can help with:

- Understanding biosignals (ECG, EEG, PPG, EMG)  
- Modeling clinical tabular data for decision support  
- Raman spectroscopy & spectral ML for early cancer detection  
- Small-data learning — a core challenge in biomedical domains  
- Model transparency to make AI safer in healthcare  

I care about building models that clinicians can trust, interpret, and use confidently.

## 🔬 What I’m Exploring Now

- Biosignal ML pipelines & feature extraction  
- Diffusion and generative models for biomedical data  
- Interpretable ML techniques (SHAP, attention mechanisms)  
- Benchmarking small clinical datasets  
- Reproducible research workflows  

I'm also developing projects for my BioAI research portfolio.

## 🎯 What I Aim to Do Next

My goal is to pursue a **Master’s in AI/ML** with a specialization in healthcare or bioinformatics in Europe.  
I want to work on problems involving:

- early disease detection  
- signal-level understanding of physiological data  
- AI systems that augment diagnosis and improve patient outcomes  

In the long run, I want to contribute to responsible, human-centered AI in medicine.

## 🌤️ Beyond Work

I enjoy learning languages, creative AI projects, and documenting my learning journey through writing and small experiments.
