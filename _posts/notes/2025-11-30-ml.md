# Machine Learning

**Machine learning** is a part of computer science that focuses on creating programs (algorithms) that can learn from examples.

- These examples can come from nature, be made by people, or be created by other programs.
- The process of machine learning is basically:

  1. **Collect a set of data** (examples related to the problem).
  2. **Use an algorithm to build a statistical model** based on that data.

- This model is then used to solve a real-world problem, such as making predictions or recognizing patterns.
